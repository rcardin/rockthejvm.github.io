At RockTheJvm we know very well the power of the Kotlin Arrow library. In details, we love the Raise DSL and its features. We already wrote about it (check out [Functional Error Handling in Kotlin, Part 3: The Raise DSL](https://blog.rockthejvm.com/functional-error-handling-in-kotlin-part-3/)), but now it's time to understand how to test an application that uses the Raise DSL. Fasten your seatbelt, because we are going to dive into the testing world of Arrow Raise.
